A very smelly room. Yuck!
A sickly room. You want to vomit.
A tasty room. Delcious!
Piss smells everywhere. So gross...
A dirty little hole in the wall bar. Grab some beers folks!
The walls are sweating. Oh the humanity!
Fuzzy floor. Fuzzy ceiling. Hmm...
What a drab color, this room. Bleh!
A smell of smoke lingers here.
Oh sweet lord why oh god no!
Help me, I'm just a sweet little, lonely room.
Stength emanates here.
A wedding seems to be set up.
A bunch of chairs everywhere. What the hell?
You're inside a giant pear. No, it doesn't make sense.
A cabin in the woods.
A run down apartment with no paid utilities.
A shameful display of flamingos.
No one seems to know what this room is for.
A kick-ass room.
A pathetic room.
A no-nonsense room.
A terror inducing room.
The walls are painted brown.
Just your run-of-the-mill cave.
A pocket universe where everything is possible.
A black hole. My word!
You are all standing on a bunch of prancing horses.
A neverending green field as far as the eye can see.
You're on a wing of a plane. It's very windy.
A cavern made out of sweets.
An underground storage facility.
Your boss's office.
A strange glass room.
A room adorned with very tacky illustrations.
A lifeless gap.
A time before time when dinosaurs ruled the world.
